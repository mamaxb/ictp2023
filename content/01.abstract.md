## Abstract {.page_break_before}
Belonging to the 3rd generation advanced high strength steels (AHSS), Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P)-steels exhibit
an excellent combination of high strength and good ductility while having a similar alloying concept as the already existing
1^st^ and 2^nd^ generation AHSS, such as DP- and TRIP-steels. While the mechanical properties are generally well
understood, Q&P-steels are still subject to current research and can not be widely found in industrial applications. Driven
by the need to decrease vehiclesâ€™ weight while maintaining high safety standards, the predictability of material behavior
under dynamic load cases in simulations is a deciding factor for successful industrial usage. To widen the understanding
of mechanical response to high-speed loading, a wide range of strain rates from 0.001s^-1^ up to 1000s^-1^ are conducted on
two grades of Q&P-steels, namely QP980 and QP1180. Special attention is given to the hardening behavior, which is
influenced by a rate-dependent TRIP effect. The effect of strain rate on the microstructure evolution is also investigated to
enable the theoretical connection of the rate-dependent TRIP effect with the respective mechanical response. The
influence of increased strength and ductility compared to classical AHSS, such as dual-phase steel DP1000, is finally
validated on a generic axial crash structure commonly found in vehicle crash management systems [@doi:10/gpxvjm].
